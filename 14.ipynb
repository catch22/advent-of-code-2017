    "The hash inputs are a key string (your puzzle input), a dash, and a number from 0 to 127 corresponding to the row. For example, if your key string were `flqrgnkx`, then the first row would be given by the bits of the knot hash of `flqrgnkx-0`, the second row from the bits of the knot hash of `flqrgnkx-1`, and so on until the last row, `flqrgnkx-127`.\n",

    "The output of a knot hash is traditionally represented by 32 hexadecimal digits; each of these digits correspond to 4 bits, for a total of 4 * 32 = 128 bits. To convert to bits, turn each hexadecimal digit to its equivalent binary value, high-bit first: `0` becomes `0000`, `1` becomes `0001`, `e` becomes `1110`, `f` becomes `1111`, and so on; a hash that begins with `a0c2017...` in hexadecimal would begin with `10100000110000100000000101110000...` in binary."
